// STL - Standard Template Library 
// -> don't need to predefine or write long long codes for an algorithm or for container


// LIBRARIES :
//    -> #include <math.h>     -> To include all libraries of math algorithms
//    -> #include <string.h>   -> To include all libraries of strings 


// #include <bits/stdc++.h>   -> Instead of writing every library, by writing "stdc++.h" all the libraries will automatically included.

// using namespace std        ->  we don't need to write " std:: " everytime  


    // SKELETON OF CODE 

    #include <bits/stdc++.h>
    using namespace std;
    int main(){
        
    //    write your code 
       
    }


// if And while Loops Difference :
    // 1. if Loop    -> Executes a Block Of code Once If a Specified Condition Is True
    // 2. while Loop -> Executes The Block Multiple Times As Long As The Condition Is True

// if And else Loops :
    //  If , If Loop Is Not Correct It Checks Else Loop.
    // To Write More Conditions if-else Loop Is Used. 


// LIST : 

// The difference between a Vector and a List is that there is no front operation in a vector, but a list has one. The remaining operations are the same.
// In List we can push-front and also emplace_front
// In List we cannot use arthermatic operations 


// STACK

// LIFO - LAST IN FIRST OUT is known as STACK
// The most generic three functions in stack is - push , pop , top
// We can't Use The " for Loop " In Stack Container and Also push_back, emplace_back.


// SET 

// Stores the elements in sorted order - Low to High
// It does not store the repeated elements only once
// Push operation is not used , instead of that insert operation is used


// MULTI-SET

// Stores the elements in sorted order
// Stores the repeated elements also
// Push operation is not used , instead of that insert operation is used


// UNORDERED-SET

// Stores the elements in unsorted order(randomized order)
// does not stores the repeated elements 


//MAP

// Store - Unique Key , Same Value 
// Stores in a Sorted Order (default)


// MULTI-MAP

// Store - Same Key , Same Value
// Stores in Sorted Order


// UNORDERED-MAP

// Store - Unique Key , Same Value 
// Not Sorted In a Order 


// BUILT-IN-POP-COUNT

// It gives the count of the number of set bits (1s) in a binary representation of a number.


// Permutation
