// STL - Standard Template Library 
// -> don't need to predefine or write long long codes for an algorithm or for container


// Libraries :
//    -> #include <math.h>     -> To include all libraries of math algorithms
//    -> #include <string.h>   -> To include all libraries of strings 


// #include <bits/stdc++.h>   -> Instead of writing every library, by writing "stdc++.h" all the libraries will automatically included.

// using namespace std        ->  we don't need to write " std:: " everytime  


    // SKELETON OF CODE 

    #include <bits/stdc++.h>
    using namespace std;
    int main(){
        
    //    write your code 
       
    }


// if And while Loops Difference :
    // 1. if Loop    -> Executes a Block Of code Once If a Specified Condition Is True
    // 2. while Loop -> Executes The Block Multiple Times As Long As The Condition Is True

// if And else Loops :
    //  If , If Loop Is Not Correct It Checks Else Loop.
    // To Write More Conditions if-else Loop Is Used. 


// The difference between a Vector and a List is that there is no front operation in a vector, but a list has one. The remaining operations are the same.
// In List we can push-front and also emplace_front
// In List we cannot use arthermatic operations
